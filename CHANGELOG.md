## [Unreleased]

## [2026-05-04]

### Added

- **Security review** landed at `audit/2026-05-04-security-review.md`. Result: cautious go for the takeover. Audit findings absorbed into the roadmap.
- **Codebase strategy decided**: cherry-pick + reference rewrite. Recorded in `ROADMAP.md`.
- Created `MIGRATION.md` — **per-feature migration ledger** with current state, strategy, implementation refs, and test status; plus the phasing from foundation through MV3 unblock.
- **Language policy decided**: JavaScript with JSDoc on production, TypeScript on tests, no build step. Recorded in `ROADMAP.md`.

## [2026-05-03]

### Added

- Established the **Unit and Integration test tiers** using Vitest and `jsdom`, including initial characterization tests for core utility modules.
- Implemented the **E2E test tier** for Firefox ESR using Puppeteer over WebDriver BiDi, with reliable extension loading and state persistence.
- Migrated to **ESLint flat config** with specialized support for legacy scripts, new ES modules, and the E2E test environment.
- Configured **GitHub Actions CI** for automated linting and full test suite validation.
